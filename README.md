# Welcome to Harbinger üîÆüßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®

**Harbinger** is a high-performance time series forecasting model built using the [**Burn**](https://burn.dev/) deep learning framework in **Rust**. This project focuses on predicting stock prices using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to capture trends and forecast future values based on historical stock data.

This project showcases how advanced AI models can be applied in real-world financial contexts, emphasizing speed, memory safety, and scalability through Rust. It also demonstrates my ability to work with cutting-edge tools and technologies while delivering accurate results for time-sensitive and resource-intensive tasks.

## Project Overview

Harbinger uses **time series forecasting** to predict stock prices based on historical data. The model is trained using daily stock prices from the Massive Yahoo Finance Dataset, leveraging an **LSTM-based architecture** to account for sequential dependencies in stock movements. This project demonstrates my expertise in applying deep learning methods for forecasting while showcasing the performance advantages of Rust.

The **goal** is to predict the closing stock prices for the next day (or future days) based on a rolling window of past prices, making this an excellent example of how deep learning can provide insights in financial forecasting.

## Key Features

### 1. **Time Series Forecasting Using LSTM**
   - **Scenario**: Predict the next day‚Äôs closing stock price using the past 30 days of stock data.
   - **Benefit**: Provides a real-world demonstration of how deep learning can be applied to financial data for trend prediction and decision-making.

### 2. **Scalable and Fast Training with Burn**
   - **Scenario**: Leverages the **Burn** deep learning framework in Rust to handle large volumes of data efficiently, while ensuring memory safety.
   - **Benefit**: Rust‚Äôs performance allows for faster training times and better resource management compared to traditional deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

### 3. **Normalized Data for Accurate Predictions**
   - **Scenario**: Data preprocessing includes normalization and lag feature creation to provide the model with the right inputs for capturing trends in stock prices.
   - **Benefit**: Ensures that the model learns from patterns without being affected by large fluctuations in the absolute values of stock prices.

### 4. **Prediction and Visualization**
   - **Scenario**: After training, the model generates predictions that can be visually compared to actual stock prices, highlighting the model‚Äôs accuracy.
   - **Benefit**: This allows for better interpretability of the model‚Äôs output, providing both numerical and graphical insights.

## Technical Architecture

Harbinger is built on the [**Burn framework**](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn), a modular and performant deep learning library in Rust. The architecture leverages LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers to capture temporal dependencies in stock prices and predict future values.

### Key Components:
1. **LSTM Model**: Processes the sequential stock data, capturing patterns and trends over time.
2. **Fully Connected (Dense) Layers**: Maps the LSTM output to a single prediction value (next day‚Äôs stock price).
3. **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to measure the prediction accuracy and optimize the model.
4. **Optimizer**: Adam Optimizer ensures fast convergence during training by adjusting learning rates dynamically.

## Use Case Scenarios

### **Financial Forecasting**
   - **Scenario**: The model is designed to predict the future closing price of stocks based on historical trends.
   - **Benefit**: Helps financial analysts and traders make data-driven decisions about stock purchases and sales.

### **Portfolio Management**
   - **Scenario**: Harbinger can be integrated into a larger portfolio management system to forecast stock movements and adjust investment strategies dynamically.
   - **Benefit**: Maximizes portfolio returns by predicting potential stock price changes.

### **Risk Assessment**
   - **Scenario**: By forecasting stock prices, Harbinger can be used to assess the risk associated with volatile assets or market conditions.
   - **Benefit**: Provides early warnings for high-risk stock movements, allowing risk mitigation strategies to be put in place.

## Future Work

- **Multi-Step Forecasting**: Extend the model to predict stock prices for multiple future days rather than just the next day.
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate additional features such as trading volume, market indicators, or moving averages to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Implement real-time stock prediction by integrating with live data feeds.
