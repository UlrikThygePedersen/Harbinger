# Overview of Burn

**Burn** is an open-source deep learning framework developed in **Rust**. It is designed to provide high performance and memory efficiency while maintaining the flexibility needed to build custom machine learning models. Burn combines the advantages of Rust’s safety features with the ability to handle large-scale data tasks, making it an ideal choice for machine learning projects like Harbinger.

## Key Features of Burn

- **Modular Design**: Burn allows for highly customizable models and layers. You can easily define and extend models by composing different building blocks, such as LSTM, GRU, and fully connected layers.
  
- **Memory Safety**: One of Rust’s core features, memory safety, carries over to Burn, preventing memory-related issues such as buffer overflows or data races that can occur during model training.
  
- **Concurrency**: Rust’s concurrency model allows Burn to efficiently parallelize operations, making it possible to train models faster by distributing computations across multiple threads or processors.

- **Backend Agnostic**: Burn can target different backends (such as CPU and GPU) through abstraction, enabling deployment in diverse environments.

## Why Burn for Harbinger?

In Harbinger, Burn is used to implement the **LSTM-based time series forecasting model**. This framework is chosen for its combination of speed, safety, and flexibility.

1. **Speed**: Burn leverages Rust’s performance to train models quickly, even with large datasets like stock market data.

2. **Memory Efficiency**: Rust’s zero-cost abstractions allow Burn to optimize resource use, ensuring that memory overhead is kept low, especially in performance-critical applications like financial forecasting.

3. **Flexibility**: With Burn’s modular structure, Harbinger can easily adjust model architecture, loss functions, and optimizers, allowing for future enhancements like multi-step forecasting.

## Burn in Action

In Harbinger, Burn is responsible for creating, training, and testing the time series forecasting model. The LSTM model defined in Burn processes input sequences (e.g., past stock prices) and predicts future prices by learning patterns from historical data.

The training process is managed by Burn’s optimization and loss modules, while inference (predictions) is handled by running the trained model on new data.

By using Burn, Harbinger delivers cutting-edge deep learning capabilities with the efficiency of Rust, ensuring a scalable, high-performance solution for time series forecasting.
